This is a simple wordpress plugin I wrote for wordpress,
its a widget where you can fill in your sever ID.

You can find the server id after the /pc/ in the battlelog URL of the server.
example: http://battlelog.battlefield.com/bf4/servers/show/pc/20200e8e-9251-4a13-971e-ad2aa3997071/FO-Frag-Out-com-Operation-Locker-Stats/
The "20200e8e-9251-4a13-971e-ad2aa3997071" is the part you need to fill into server-ID in the widget.

After that you can customize the width en height of the widget.
